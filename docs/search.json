Challenges and How I overcame them\nGiven the many datasets I have, I was unsure if I should include certain datasets on Thai and Japanese dramas and their respective user reviews and actor information, as they are not directly related to the question. I eventually decided to only select information that would be useful for a more comprehensive analysis and comparison across different cultural contexts – basic information like the name, year the drama was released, genres, tags, total number of episodes, and other ranking and reviews from users.\nIf I realise I require additional information for comparison in the future, I will include more information on user reviews on Thai and Japanese dramas. Similarly, if I realise the amount of data I have now is excessive and unnecessary to investigate the factors behind the popularity of K-Dramas globally, I will remove these datasets on Thai and Japanese Dramas."

    "text": "1. K-Dramas Generally Have The Highest Ratings\nRatings are an essential metric in evaluating the success and popularity of dramas, providing valuable insight into audience reception and their preferences.\nGenerally, the higher or more positive ratings a drama receives, be it quantitatively or qualitatively, the greater its appeal and impact on viewers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterquartile Range (IQR)\nWhen we look at the IQR of all 3 boxplots, the ratings for K-Drama seem to have the greatest dispersion of 0.7, compared to Japanese with 0.6, and Thai with 0.5.\nThe larger IQR may reflect differences in the quality of K-dramas. Some K-dramas may receive very high ratings from a segment of viewers, while others receive lower ratings from a different segment, resulting in a broader range of ratings.\nMedian\nHowever, despite this, K-Dramas still enjoy the highest average ratings.\nComparing the medians, or average ratings, of Japanese, Thai, and Korean dramas from 2018 to 2023, it seems that it is a close fight among all 3 languages. Each are doing relatively well in the market with high ratings in the 7 points region (out of 10).\nHowever, K-Dramas ultimately emerge as the frontrunner with an average rating of 7.80, with Japanese dramas following closely behind with an average rating of 7.70, and lastly, Thai dramas with a nonetheless commendable average rating of 7.60.\nThis shows that while each language’s dramas have their own unique charm that garner them a significant fan base and presence, K-Dramas stand out, appealing to and resonating with the audiences the most.\nMaximum\nMoreover, K-Dramas evidently have the highest peak rating of 9.20, compared to Japanese’s 8.80, and Thai’s 8.70, reinforcing K-Drama’s dominance and immense appeal to audiences that led to exceptionally high ratings.\nIf this dosen’t sound impressive enough, wait till we look at how K-Drama ratings have progressed across time, particularly in the form of concrete scores that users give!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s split the time period of 2018 to 2023 to 3 smaller periods - pre-COVID years (2018 to 2019), COVID years (2020 to 2021), and post-COVID years (2022 to 2023).\nIn the pre-COVID years, K-Dramas maintained a competitive edge over Thai and Japanese dramas with higher user scores around 7.6. However, during the COVID years, K-Dramas experienced a significant dip to the 7.5 points region - the lowest it has ever been, as compared to Japanese dramas which rose steadily.\nYet in a turn of events, in the post-COVID years, the average user scores of K-Dramas abruptly picked up in 2021 and rose exponentially to a record high of 7.81 in 2023, maintaining an increasing upward trend from 2021 to 2023. Meanwhile, the average user scores for both Thai and Japanese dramas generally dipped to the 7.4 and 7.5 points region respectively by 2023, demonstrating a falling trend.\nThis could be attributed to the release of the Korean survival series drama, Squid Game, on 17 September 2021, which exploded on the international scene. In fact, Squid Game was crowned as Netflix’s most-watched non-English series, with a staggering amount of 2,205,200,000 hours viewed as of March 31, 2024 (Netflix, n.d.), and one of the most popular K-Dramas internationally as of December 2022 (Statista, 2023a).\n\n\n\nSquid Game | source: Netflix\n\n\nIt is likely that Squid Game’s widespread popularity catapulted K-Dramas into the global spotlight, attracting new international audiences and interest. This recognition of Squid Game also likely prompted increased investment into Korean content from producers and streaming platforms in light of the rising viewership and interest from audiences from all over the world, solidifying its dominance in the market and entertainment industry."

    "text": "2. Streaming Services Like Netflix Are Crucial for Outreach\nSpeaking of Netflix, the channels in which dramas are aired on play a crucial role in determining the amount of viewership dramas receive, and the outreach they have to global audiences.\nIn particular, global channels, mainly streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and Hulu (Statista, 2024), give audiences convenient access to international content, easily introducing new titles and dramas to them.\nFind out how common the channel you use to watch K-Dramas is among global audiences here!\n \nAmong the global streaming services-giant, Netflix is a clear winner in terms of the market share, garnering the most users who rely on their service to access dramas.\nThis suggests that dramas which are either produced, distributed, or aired by Netflix is likely able to tap into a greater audience pool, have greater outreach, and enjoy bolstered viewership.\n\n\n\nNetflix | source: Pixabay\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the distribution of dramas on global channels like Amazon, Disney+, Hulu, and Netflix!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s address the part of the graph that probably caught your eye first - the extremely long orange bar under the “Netflix” category, on the x-axis.\nAt one glance, we can see that among the global channels, K-Dramas utilise Netflix the most to distribute its dramas, with the highest count of 130 dramas uploaded there, as compared to 31 for Japanese, and 13 for Thai. That’s significantly more than the other dramas!\nMoreover, K-Dramas have the most number of dramas in total (163) that are distributed on global channels, as compared to Japanese dramas with a close number of 112, and Thai with an almost negligible count of 15.\nGiven Netflix’s dominance in the streaming service industry, Korea is able to leverage the channel’s extensive connections with audiences from all over the world, bolstering its market outreach by making its dramas more accessible to potential global audiences.\nCombined with the sheer quantity of dramas that Korea is distributing on global channels that audiences frequently use to access international content, it reflects Korea’s deliberate strategy of going beyond the South Korean market, and instead targeting and supplying international markets with content.\nIt is no wonder why K-Dramas manages to achieve high global viewership and outreach to international audiences - a great strategy indeed!"
