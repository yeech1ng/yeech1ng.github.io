Have you ever wondered why almost everyone around you watches, or at least knows the names of some K-Dramas? If so...

Hello and welcome to my data story! :)

![source: me](images/finalproj_1){width="900"}

As an avid K-Drama watcher, I thought it would be interesting to investigate: **"What makes K-Dramas so popular globally?"**, and showcase the driving factors for my final project.

I used several data sets from Kaggle, namely data on the top 5000 dramas which includes information on the name, episodes, released year, language (selected only Korean, Thai, and Japanese), rating, and ranking.

Others included specific data on the name, year, genres, tags, episode number, the platform it was aired on, user score, and rank for Korean, Thai, and Japanese Dramas. I also used data on the user reviews for each language's dramas, which included ratings on the story, acting cast, music, rewatch value, and the overall ranking. This was so I could have a better basis for comparison.

# Introduction

In recent years, the film and television industries have seen exponential growth, with the global entertainment market topping USD\$100 billion for the first time ever in 2019 (Escandon, 2020). Moreover, given the onset of globalisation and the rise of streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, viewers have greater access to shows that are produced and distributed worldwide.

With an increasing influx of shows in the market, this has created a fast-paced and competitive climate that makes it difficult for producers and creators to stand out.

# Hallyu & The Dominance of K-Dramas

However, amidst this competitive landscape, Korean dramas, or K-Dramas, have managed to carve out a unique niche and capture the attention of audiences globally.

In a 2023 survey conducted across 26 countries, **majority of respondents (88.8%)** stated that K-Dramas are **popular** in their countries, and only a small minority (11.2%) reported that it is not.

Evidently, K-Dramas enjoy high popularity from audiences from all around the world beyond Korea, highlighting the **widespread interest** in K-Dramas on a global scale. This has generated significant financial gains for South Korea’s economy, with K-Drama exports increasing by **over 72%** in recent years (Statista, 2023).

In fact, this is part of the larger cultural phenomenon known as **“Hallyu”, or the Korean Wave**, which refers to the global craze for South Korean pop culture and other cultural elements, which includes entertainment like K-Dramas and K-Pop.

This begs the question: How does Korea do this? In particular, how did K-Dramas **garner so much popularity and continuously stay on top of the game**? What can other region’s entertainment industry learn from South Korea?

Let's find out!

# Comparison with Japanese and Thai Dramas

Let us first start with comparing some data between Korean, Japanese, and Thai dramas for some insights on their differences and similarities in terms of the dramas they produce.

## 1. K-Dramas Generally Have The Highest Ratings

Ratings are an essential metric in evaluating the success and popularity of dramas, providing valuable insight into audience reception and their preferences. 

Generally, the higher or more positive ratings a drama receives, be it quantitatively or qualitatively, the greater its appeal and impact on viewers. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
suppressMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
    library(ggplot2)
    library(RColorBrewer)
    library(tidyverse)
  
top_5000dramas <- read.csv("datasets/top_5000_dramas.csv")

top_5000dramas_filtered <- top_5000dramas %>%
  filter(released_year >= 2018 & grepl("Japanese|Thai|Korean", Language))

colors <- brewer.pal(3, "Set2") 

# Calculate average ratings for each language
avg_ratings <- top_5000dramas_filtered %>%
  group_by(Language) %>%
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE))

# Create a bar plot
bp2 <- ggplot(avg_ratings, aes(x = Language, y = avg_rating, fill = Language)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Average Ratings of Thai, Japanese, and Korean Dramas from 2018 to 2023",
       x = "Language", y = "Average Rating") +
  theme_bw() + scale_fill_manual(values = colors)

ggplotly(bp2)

  })
})

}

Comparing the average ratings of Japanese, Thai, and Korean dramas from 2018 to 2023, it seems that it is a close fight between all 3 languages. Each are doing relatively well in the market with high ratings in the 7 points region (out of 10). 

However, K-Dramas ultimately emerge as the **frontrunner with an average rating of 7.86**, with Japanese dramas following closely behind with an average rating of 7.69, and lastly, Thai dramas with a nonetheless commendable average rating of 7.59. 

This shows that while each language’s dramas have their own unique charm that garner them a significant fan base and presence, K-Dramas stand out, **appealing to and resonating with the audiences the most**. 

This is further reinforced when analysing how ratings have progressed across time for each language's drama, particularly in the form of concrete scores that users give. 

Looking at this, let's split the time period of 2018 to 2023 to 3 smaller periods - pre-COVID years (2018 to 2019), COVID years (2020 to 2021), and post-COVID years (2022 to 2023).

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}


general_kdrama <- read.csv("datasets/kor_drama.csv")
general_tdrama <- read.csv("datasets/tha_drama.csv")
general_jdrama <- read.csv("datasets/jap_drama.csv")

# Convert year to numeric 
suppressWarnings({
general_kdrama$year <- as.numeric(as.character(general_kdrama$year))
general_tdrama$year <- as.numeric(as.character(general_tdrama$year))
general_jdrama$year <- as.numeric(as.character(general_jdrama$year))
})

# Filter data and calculate average rating per year
kdrama_avg_rating <- general_kdrama %>%
  filter(year >= 2018) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_user_score = mean(tot_user_score, na.rm = TRUE), language = "Korean")

tdrama_avg_rating <- general_tdrama %>%
  filter(year >= 2018) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_user_score = mean(tot_user_score, na.rm = TRUE), language = "Thai")

jdrama_avg_rating <- general_jdrama %>%
  filter(year >= 2018) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_user_score = mean(tot_user_score, na.rm = TRUE), language = "Japanese")

# Combine the dataframes
combined_data <- bind_rows(kdrama_avg_rating, tdrama_avg_rating, jdrama_avg_rating)

# Colours
colors <- brewer.pal(3, "Set2")

# Plot the line graph
lg1 <- ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = year, y = avg_user_score, colour=language)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "User Scores from 2018 to 2023", x = "Year", y = "Average User Score") +
  theme_bw() +  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2")

ggplotly(lg1)

```

```{=html}
<style>
hr {
  border: none;
  height: 2px; /* Adjust the height as needed */
  background-color: #ccc; /* Adjust the color as needed */
  margin: 10px 0; /* Adjust the margin as needed */
}
</style>
```

In the pre-COVID years, K-Dramas maintained a **competitive edge** over Thai and Japanese dramas with higher user scores around **7.6**. However, during the COVID years, K-Dramas experienced a **significant dip to the 7.5 points region** - the lowest it has ever been, as compared to Japanese dramas which rose steadily.

Yet in a turn of events, in the post-COVID years, the average user scores of K-Dramas abruptly picked up in 2021 and **rose exponentially to a record high of 7.81 in 2023**, maintaining an increasing upward trend from 2021 to 2023. Meanwhile, the average user scores for both Thai and Japanese dramas **generally dipped to the 7.4 and 7.5 points region** respectively by 2023, demonstrating a falling trend.

This could  be attributed to the release of the Korean survival series drama, **Squid Game**, in 17 September 2021, which exploded on the international scene. In fact, Squid Game was crowned as Netflix's most-watched non-English series, with a staggering amount of 2,205,200,000 hours viewed as of March 31, 2024 (Netflix, n.d.), and one of the Most popular South-Korean dramas internationally as of December 2022 (Statista, 2023a).

It is likely that Squid Game's widespread popularity catapulted K-Dramas into the global spotlight, attracting new international audiences and interest. This recognition of Squid Game also likely prompted increased investment in Korean content from producers and streaming platforms in light of the rising viewership and interest from audiences from all over the world, solidifying its dominance in the market. 

Now that we have proven Korean's status as one of the most dominant forces in the global entertainment industry, let's focus more on the factors...

Across all 3 languages, there is a common trend of **dramas with less episodes receiving a higher rating**, though this is most evident in K-Dramas.

However, within a shorter episode count from 0 to 25, K-Dramas still lead and **surpass Thai and Japanese dramas** with a consistently higher rating. In fact, the highest rating drama (9.2) in the entire graph is a K-Drama!

This is possibly due to...
