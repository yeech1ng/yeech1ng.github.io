Have you ever wondered why almost everyone around you watches, or at least knows the names of some K-Dramas? If so...

Hello and welcome to my data story! :)

As an avid K-Drama watcher, I thought it would be interesting to investigate and showcase the driving factors of: 

<span style="font-size: 25px;">**Why are K-Dramas so popular globally?**</span>

# Data Sets

I used several data sets from Kaggle, namely data on the [top 5000 Asian dramas](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmiindukosuri/top-5000-dramas-1983-2023) which includes information on the name, episodes, released year, language (selected only Korean, Thai, and Japanese), rating, and ranking.

Here's a quick preview of the top rows!

```{r dataset_preview, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
top_5000dramas <- read.csv("datasets/top_5000_dramas.csv")
top_5000dramas_filtered <- top_5000dramas %>%
      filter(released_year >= 2018 & grepl("Japanese|Thai|Korean", Language))
kable(head(top_5000dramas_filtered))
  })
})

```

To supplement this, I made use of other more specific [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chanoncharuchinda/thai-and-japanese-drama-vs-korean-drama-dominance?select=kor_user_reviews.csv) on the name, year, genres, tags, episode number, the platform it was aired on, user score, and rank for Korean, Thai, and Japanese Dramas.

I also used data on the user reviews for each language's dramas, which included ratings on the story, acting cast, music, rewatch value, and the overall ranking. This was so I could have a better basis for comparison!

# Introduction

In recent years, the film and television industries have seen exponential growth, with the global entertainment market topping USD$100 billion for the first time ever in 2019 (Escandon, 2020). Moreover, given the onset of globalisation and the rise of streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, viewers have greater access to shows that are produced and distributed worldwide.

With an increasing influx of shows in the market, this has created a fast-paced and competitive climate that makes it difficult for producers and creators to stand out.

# Hallyu & The Dominance of K-Dramas

However, amidst this competitive landscape, Korean dramas, or K-Dramas, have managed to carve out a unique niche and capture the attention of audiences globally.

In a 2023 survey conducted across 26 countries, **majority of respondents (88.8%)** stated that K-Dramas are **popular** in their countries, and only a small minority (11.2%) reported that it is not.

Evidently, K-Dramas enjoy high popularity from audiences from all around the world beyond Korea, highlighting the **widespread interest** in K-Dramas on a global scale. This has generated significant financial gains for South Korea’s economy, with K-Drama exports increasing by **over 72%** in recent years (Statista, 2023b).

In fact, this is part of the larger cultural phenomenon known as **“Hallyu”, or the Korean Wave**, which refers to the global craze for South Korean pop culture and other cultural elements, which includes entertainment like K-Dramas and K-Pop.

This begs the question: How does Korea do this? In particular, how did K-Dramas **garner so much popularity and continuously stay on top of the game**? What can other region’s entertainment industry learn from South Korea?

Let's find out!

# Comparison with Japanese and Thai Dramas

Let us first start with comparing some data between Korean, Japanese, and Thai dramas for some insights on their differences and similarities in terms of the dramas they produce.

## 1. K-Dramas Generally have the Highest Ratings

Ratings are an essential metric in evaluating the success and popularity of dramas, providing valuable insight into audience reception and their preferences. 

Generally, the higher or more positive ratings a drama receives, be it quantitatively or qualitatively, the greater its appeal and impact on viewers. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
suppressMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
    library(ggplot2)
    library(RColorBrewer)
    library(tidyverse)
  
    top_5000dramas <- read.csv("datasets/top_5000_dramas.csv")

    top_5000dramas_filtered <- top_5000dramas %>%
      filter(released_year >= 2018 & grepl("Japanese|Thai|Korean", Language))

    colors <- brewer.pal(3, "Set2") 

    # Calculate average ratings for each language
    avg_ratings <- top_5000dramas_filtered %>%
      group_by(Language) %>%
      summarize(avg_rating = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE))

    # Create a boxplot
    bp2 <- ggplot(top_5000dramas_filtered, aes(x = Language, y = Rating, fill = Language)) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      labs(title = "Ratings of Thai, Japanese, and Korean Dramas from 2018 to 2023",
           x = "Language", y = "Rating") +
      theme_bw() + scale_fill_manual(values = colors)

    ggplotly(bp2)
  })
})


```

```{=html}

hr {
  border: none;
  height: 2px; /* Adjust the height as needed */
  background-color: #ccc; /* Adjust the color as needed */
  margin: 10px 0; /* Adjust the margin as needed */
}
</style>
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Interquartile Range (IQR)**

When we look at the IQR of all 3 boxplots, the ratings for K-Drama seem to have the **greatest dispersion of 0.7**, compared to Japanese with 0.6, and Thai with 0.5.

The larger IQR may reflect differences in the quality of K-dramas. Some K-dramas may receive very high ratings from a segment of viewers, while others receive lower ratings from a different segment, resulting in a broader range of ratings.

**Median**

However, despite this, K-Dramas still enjoy the **highest average ratings**.

Comparing the medians, or average ratings, of Japanese, Thai, and Korean dramas from 2018 to 2023, it seems that it is a close fight among all 3 languages. Each are doing relatively well in the market with high ratings in the 7 points region (out of 10). 

However, K-Dramas ultimately emerge as the **frontrunner with an average rating of 7.80**, with Japanese dramas following closely behind with an average rating of 7.70, and lastly, Thai dramas with a nonetheless commendable average rating of 7.60.

This shows that while each language’s dramas have their own unique charm that garner them a significant fan base and presence, K-Dramas stand out, **appealing to and resonating with the audiences the most**. 

**Maximum**

Moreover, K-Dramas evidently have the **highest peak rating of 9.20**, compared to Japanese's 8.80, and Thai's 8.70, reinforcing K-Drama's dominance and immense appeal to audiences that led to exceptionally high ratings.

If this dosen't sound impressive enough, wait till we look at how K-Drama ratings have progressed across time, particularly in the form of concrete scores that users give!

Let's split the time period of 2018 to 2023 to 3 smaller periods - pre-COVID years (2018 to 2019), COVID years (2020 to 2021), and post-COVID years (2022 to 2023).

In the pre-COVID years, K-Dramas maintained a **competitive edge** over Thai and Japanese dramas with higher user scores around **7.6**. However, during the COVID years, K-Dramas experienced a **significant dip to the 7.5 points region** - the lowest it has ever been, as compared to Japanese dramas which rose steadily.

Yet in a turn of events, in the post-COVID years, the average user scores of K-Dramas abruptly picked up in 2021 and **rose exponentially to a record high of 7.81 in 2023**, maintaining an increasing upward trend from 2021 to 2023. Meanwhile, the average user scores for both Thai and Japanese dramas **generally dipped to the 7.4 and 7.5 points region** respectively by 2023, demonstrating a falling trend.

This could  be attributed to the release of the Korean survival series drama, **Squid Game**, on 17 September 2021, which exploded on the international scene. In fact, Squid Game was crowned as Netflix's most-watched non-English series, with a staggering amount of 2,205,200,000 hours viewed as of March 31, 2024 (Netflix, n.d.), and one of the most popular K-Dramas internationally as of December 2022 (Statista, 2023a).

![Squid Game | source: Netflix](images/squidgame.png){width="550"}

It is likely that Squid Game's widespread popularity catapulted K-Dramas into the global spotlight, attracting new international audiences and interest. This recognition of Squid Game also likely prompted increased investment into Korean content from producers and streaming platforms in light of the rising viewership and interest from audiences from all over the world, solidifying its dominance in the market and entertainment industry.

## 2. Streaming Services like Netflix are Crucial for Outreach

Speaking of Netflix, the channels in which dramas are aired on play a crucial role in determining the amount of viewership dramas receive, and the outreach they have to global audiences. 

In particular, global channels, mainly streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and Hulu (Statista, 2024), give audiences convenient access to international content, easily introducing new titles and dramas to them. 

Find out how common the channel you use to watch K-Dramas is among global audiences here!

```{=html}
<iframe height="200" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://yeech1ng.shinyapps.io/sample_app/ "> </iframe>
```

Among the global streaming services-giant, Netflix is a clear winner in terms of the market share, garnering the most users who rely on their service to access dramas.

This suggests that dramas which are either **produced, distributed, or aired by Netflix** is likely able to tap into a **greater audience pool**, have **greater outreach**, and enjoy **bolstered viewership**.

Let's address the part of the graph that probably caught your eye first - the extremely long orange bar under the "Netflix" category, on the x-axis. 

At one glance, we can see that among the global channels, **K-Dramas utilise Netflix the most** to distribute its dramas, with the **highest count of 130 dramas** uploaded there, as compared to 31 for Japanese, and 13 for Thai. That's significantly more than the other dramas! 

Moreover, K-Dramas have the **most number of dramas in total (163) that are distributed on global channels**, as compared to Japanese dramas with a close number of 112, and Thai with an almost negligible count of 15.

Given Netflix's dominance in the streaming service industry, Korea is able to leverage the channel's extensive connections with audiences from all over the world, bolstering its market outreach by making its dramas more accessible to potential global audiences. 

Combined with the sheer quantity of dramas that Korea is distributing on global channels that audiences frequently use to access international content, it reflects Korea's deliberate strategy of going beyond the South Korean market, and instead targeting and supplying international markets with content.

It is no wonder why K-Dramas manages to achieve high global viewership and outreach to international audiences - a great strategy indeed!

## 3. Production Volume does not Matter?

Based on our previous observations, it seems that quantity may potentially be a key driving factor of global popularity? 

Let's investigate and see if this is true, particularly in terms of the general production volume of dramas into the market!

Here, I have a graph with the yearly production of Korean, Thai, and Japanese dramas. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

      mutate(across(c(ep_duration, tot_eps), as.integer),
             year = as.integer(year))

      labs(title = "Yearly Production of Korean, Thai, and Japanese Dramas",
           x = "Year",
           y = "Proportion of Total Number of Dramas Produced") +
      theme_bw()
  })

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<!-- Content -->

In the earlier years from 2018 to 2020, the proportion of K-Dramas produced was generally consistently the highest among Thai and Japanese dramas.

However, in the recent years from 2021 to 2023, it seems that the proportion of K-Dramas are falling and getting increasingly smaller, as compared to the growing proportion of Thai and Japanese dramas.

Hmm...this may mean that production volume is not as crucial of a factor in driving popularity, since it is in-congruent with the growing international popularity of K-Dramas. 

## 4. K-Dramas are Cutting Down on Episode Count

Closely related to production volume is episode count, more specifically the number of episodes that each drama produces. 

For those of you who may be unfamiliar with this terminology, Cambridge Dictionary defines an episode as "one programme of a series shown on television" (ambridge Dictionary, 2024), or in this case, dramas in our case. 

Let's see if our previous conclusion that quantity may not be a key driving factor holds through in terms of episode count!

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

suppressMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)

# Calculate average number of episodes for each language drama per year
average_episodes <- top_5000dramas_filtered %>%
  group_by(released_year, Language) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Episodes = mean(Episodes))

# Rename column titles
colnames(average_episodes) <- c("Released Year", "Language", "Average No. of Episodes")

# Print the table using kableExtra
kable(average_episodes, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
 })
})

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow, that's a lot of numbers! But don't worry, let's unpack them slowly. 

Zooming in on the year 2018, it is clear that K-Dramas have the **highest average number of episodes among the rest (24.01)**, suggesting that K-Dramas used to be very loooong.

However, looking at how the average number of episodes have changed across the years for K-Dramas in relation to the other languages, it seems that there is a prominent **trend of Korea cutting down on the number of episodes produced**. 

In fact, K-Dramas have ultimately **reduced their episode count the most significantly** from around 24 to 12 episodes. This is a whopping reduction of 12 episodes, half of the origianl amount!

Meanwhile, Japanese and Thai dramas have only reduced their episode count by around 3 episodes, from 12 to 9, and 15 to 12 respectively, which is a much smaller number compared to Korea. 

What does this suggest? Does this mean there is a correlation between shorter episode count and higher popularity?

Well...not quite.

In 2023, although K-Dramas have experienced the most significant reduction in episode count, Japanese dramas still ultimately have the least average number of episodes, yet they still lose out to Korea in terms of ratings and popularity as established earlier. 

In fact, this is supported by the scatter plot shown below!

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

suppressMessages({
  suppressWarnings({

library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Select relevant columns and filter data

       y = "Rating",

Unfortunately, there dosen't seem to be a clear relationship between episode count and user ratings, which is an indication of popularity as established earlier. This means that **we cannot decisively conclude that there is a negative correlation between episode count and popularity**, so it's not true that the shorter the episode count, the higher ratings a drama will receive, and consequently, popularity. 

This solidifies our conclusion from the previous section on production volume on how quantity may not be as important in driving popularity!

However, remember the discovery we made earlier on  K-Dramas experiencing the most significant reduction in episode count among the rest, as well as the previous observation that K-Dramas is cutting down on production volume (Section 3)? 

While not conclusive, this can suggest that K-Dramas are **shifting their focus from sheer quantity, to quality** of the dramas produced. It seems reasonable to infer that extra resources for generating more dramas and episodes is instead diverted to ensuring dramas produced are of of top-notch quality with high quality content.

With that, let's test this theory out!

## 5. All About Drama Content and Genres

For many audiences, genres is something important they consider when choosing what shows, including dramas to watch. According to Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, genre is defined as "a category of artistic, musical, or literary composition characterised by a particular style, form, or content" (Reich, 2017). 

In our case, a drama's genre can influence what audiences think of dramas even before watching it, as it shapes audiences' perception of whether they think the drama's content will appeal to them.

### 5.1 Variety of Genres

There are a wide variety of genres that a drama can be categorised into, including romance, action, comedy, horror, thriller, just to name a few.

Check out how many distinct genres each language's dramas have below!

What's interesting is that Japanese dramas have the greatest variety, and not Korea. 

However, this also means that we can't attribute K-Drama's global popularity to having the largest variety of genres which would naturally appeal to more audiences. It hints to us that although variety may be an influencing factor given the negligble difference of 1 between Japanese dramas, perhaps it is not as important of a factor.

### 5.2 Specific Genres Types

Let's turn our attention to the specific genre types. 

Can you guess what the most popular genre in K-Dramas is? Simply click on the button of the option you think is right!

```

As we have learnt, most K-Dramas produced will probably be of the romance genre. 

But does this mean that romance genre dramas have a higher chance of being more popular globally? Let's find out but taking a look at this bar plot with the distribution of dramas among the top 10 genres.

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**Trend 1**</span>

Zooming into the "Romance" category, although it shows how the most popular genre among K-Dramas is romance, Korea is not actually the leading producer of romance dramas, but rather, Thailand! 

This is rather surprising! Let's take a closer look at romance dramas only, and examine the user ratings. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<!-- Content -->

From the boxplots, we see that **K-Dramas have the highest median, or average user ratings (7.90) for its romance dramas**, as compared to Japanese and Thai (both 7.60). 

Additionally, it also has the **highest peak user rating at 9 compared to the rest**, with Japanese dramas having a peak of 8.80, and Thai dramas with a 8.60 peak. 

Evidently, despite Thai dramas being the leading producer of romance genres, it has the lowest user rating peak, proving once again that quantity is not everything! 

This also means that **we cannot conclude that romance dramas is positively correlated with higher rankings and popularity**. Although Korea loses out in the highest production of romance K-Dramas, it must be doing something else right, presumably the quality of the content, for it to be receiving significantly high ratings and popularity among viewers. 

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**Trend 2**</span>

Going back to the bar plot graph, another prominent trend is that Korea is leading in the production of only 2 genre types out of the 10 - **Melodrama**, and **Youth**. 

This can suggest that these genres are up and rising genres that a rising number of audiences globally are interested in, which thus contributed to K-Drama's increasing popularity as they continue to produce Melodrama and Youth dramas.

In fact, this conclusion is supported when we examine the ratings of K-Dramas that are of Melodrama and Youth genres. 

**Melodrama Genre Drama: **

![Descendants Of The Sun | source: Amazon](images/des_of_the_sun.jpeg){width="500"}

Descendants of The Sun is an old time classic released in 2016, telling the "love story that develops between a surgeon and a special forces officer", where they "find themselves in the middle of great events and deadly dangers, both in their Motherland and in the fictitious, war-torn country of Urk" (IMDb, n.d.-a).

According to the Korean Culture and Information Service (2016), the drama has a rights agreement in 32 countries, and has been sold in Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, in the Middle East, Asia, and Oceania. 
including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Middle East, Europe. Evidently, the drama did extremely well in the market even back in 2016, and can be considered a watershed milestone that paved the way for K-Drama's increasing international recognition and popularity. 

**Youth Genre Drama: Twenty Five Twenty One**

If you have not watched this, Twenty Five Twenty One is a K-Drama that "tells the stories of youth who find new direction and growth after having their dreams taken away" (IMDb, n.d.-b), and focuses on the inexorable passage of time from youth to adulthood.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<!-- Content -->

The K-Drama achieved resounding success, ranking in Netflix’s Global Top 10 list of non-English language shows and became the most-watched program in its time slot in South Korea throughout its run (Kim, 2022). 

Although these are only 2 examples out of the many, this goes to show that a plausible reason for K-Drama's growing popularity is its ability to tap into burgeoning genres before others catch up, establishing its dominance and leading position.

### 5.3 A Closer Look at Drama Tags

At this point, you may be interested in a more in-depth examination of the specific content and descriptions of the dramas, beyond its genre. 

One way to analyse this would be to look at the tags a drama is associated with!

Check out the most frequently occuring description tags for Korean, Japanese, and Thai dramas! The larger a word, the more times it has appeared. Feel free to hover over the word to see the number of times it has appeared.

```{=html}
<iframe height="500" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://yeech1ng.shinyapps.io/wordcloud_app/"> </iframe>
```

After looking through all 3 word clouds, did you notice a pattern?

For all 3 drama languages, it seems that commonly occurring words are "lead", "male", and "female", which suggest that the male and female leads of dramas are essential to dramas. This brings me to my point on actors, in which I will elaborate later on in Section 6. 

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**K-Dramas Focuses On Its Female Leads**</span>

However, for now, a point to note is that K-Dramas are the only dramas where the word "female" occurs more frequently than "male, as compared to Japanese and Thai. 

What does this mean? While there may be many reasons for this, a reason I believe strongly in is that unlike Japanese and Thai dramas, K-Dramas tend to focus on appealing to its female viewers, or what modern society coins as "appealing to the female gaze".

This is done primarily through the way that K-Dramas writes its female characters into a wide range of roles from a journalist, lawyer, to even a queen. Female characters are also increasingly depicted in positions of power, deviating from traditional gendered tropes where female characters are depicted as weak and needy who is later saved by a rich and strong male character. 

In fact, in Korea, the number of female screenwriters is closer to 90% (MacDonald, 2019), which can explain why a growing number of K-Dramas often provide a feminist perspective, and avoid portraying their male leads in a way that sexually objectifies female characters. 

This is likely to have made K-Dramas' plot lines more refreshing and interesting for audiences, particularly female viewers, evident in the wordcloud where "female leads" are more talked about. This has likely contributed to enhanced viewership and popularity. 

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**Thai Dramas Feature More Controversial Topics**</span>

Looking at the wordcloud for Thai dramas, 2 words that stand out to me are "gay" (mentioned 386 times) and "lgbtq" (mentioned 242 times). Although these are not the most frequently occurring words, the fact that the wordcloud for both Korean and Japanese drama do not feature these words suggest that these topics are unique to Thai dramas. 

We note that issues relating to gender identity and sexual orientation are still considered controversial in today's society due to disagreements over whether gender can be considered a social construct, as evident in the prejudice and discrimination towards the LGBTQ+ community by certain more conservative groups that do not believe in the fluidity of gender. 

How does this translate to the world of dramas? 

Well, the views that these groups carry may make them less accepting of when drama characters are part of the LGBTQ community, and exhibit traits that are not expected of their sex, such as if a male character is gay and exhibits feminine traits, and vice versa. 

As such, since K-Dramas do not regularly feature characters or plot lines that revolve around controversial topics like LGBTQ+ unlike Thai dramas, it may appeal to more groups of audiences, and thus contributing to greater viewership and overall popularity. 

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**Japanese Dramas Have More Adaptations**</span>

You may be wondering: Why is it that Japanese dramas still ultiamtely have a lower rating and popularity than K-Dramas despite not regularly featuring controversial topics? 

Well, looking at the wordcloud for Japanese dramas, I would like to point out the word "adapted", which has occurred quite frequently (581 times) along with the words "lead", "male", "female", and "character". 

This seems to suggest that many Japanese dramas seem to be adaptations of  existing books, shows, and films, which is not as original as newly produced story created from scratch. 

In fact, according to a survey done by SuperSummary (n.d.), an online resource that provides study guides for fiction and nonfiction books, it found that almost half (46%) of respondents argued that film adaptations "would never be as good as the book", with almost 25% declaring that movies even ruined the original book. 

Hence, although Japanese dramas do not feature controversial issues like Thai dramas, the problem may lie in the lack of original content of the dramas produced, which deters audiences who are seeking fresh and new plot lines in dramas. 

This is perhaps something that K-Dramas manages to deliver to audiences, hooking them in with innovative and original content! 

### 5.4 Examining Drama Storylines

An integral part of the content is the story-line of the drama, or what others may call the plot. 

Good storytelling can help to captivate audiences and ensure the success of any media content, from books to shows. 

But is this an important factor driving K-Drama's popularity? Let's investigate!

Over here, we have 3 plots comparing the user ratings on the drama's story-line for Korea, Thai, and Japanese dramas. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
suppressMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
    # Load required libraries
    library(dplyr)
    library(plotly)
    library(RColorBrewer)

    # Read datasets
    kreviews <- read.csv("datasets/kor_user_reviews.csv", fileEncoding="UTF-8")
    treviews <- read.csv("datasets/tha_user_reviews.csv")
    jreviews <- read.csv("datasets/jap_user_reviews.csv")

    # Combine all data into one dataframe
    all_reviews <- bind_rows(
      mutate(kreviews, language = "Korean"),
      mutate(treviews, language = "Thai"),
      mutate(jreviews, language = "Japanese")
    )

    # Define color palette using colorbrewer
    palette <- brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Set2")

    # Create boxplot with plotly
    plot_ly(all_reviews, x = ~language, y = ~story, type = 'box', 
            marker = list(color = palette)) %>%
      layout(title = "Distribution of User Ratings on Drama's Story",
             xaxis = list(title = "Language"),
             yaxis = list(title = "Rating on Story"),
             showlegend = FALSE)
  })
})

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interestingly, it seems that the median (9), and peak (10) ratings for all 3 languages are the same! Additionally, between Japanese and Korea dramas, the IQR is the same at 3. Meanwhile, Thai drams have a greater IQR of 3.5, which suggests a higher variability and greater spread between the values

Hmm...what does this tell us about story-lines as driving factor? 

It seems that story-lines do not have as much influence on driving up popularity ranking, since the user ratings on storylines are generally the same across all 3 languages. 

To get greater clarity, let's look at scatter plots showing the correlation between user ratings on drama's story and the overall ratings. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Read data from CSV files
kreviews <- read.csv("datasets/kor_user_reviews.csv")
treviews <- read.csv("datasets/tha_user_reviews.csv")
jreviews <- read.csv("datasets/jap_user_reviews.csv")

# Combine data and add language column
kreviews$language <- "Korean"
treviews$language <- "Thai"
jreviews$language <- "Japanese"
all_reviews <- bind_rows(kreviews, treviews, jreviews)

# Create correlation plot with facet_wrap
palette <- brewer.pal(3, "Set2")  # Get color palette
suppressMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
    ggplot(all_reviews, aes(x = story, y = overall, color = language)) +
      geom_jitter(show.legend = FALSE) +
      geom_smooth(show.legend = FALSE, method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE, color = "black", size = 1) +
      ggtitle("Correlation between Story Ratings and Overall Ratings") +
      xlab("Story Ratings") +
      ylab("Overall Ratings") +
      scale_color_manual(values = palette) + 
      facet_wrap(~language)
  })
})

```

}
</style>
```

Once again, for all 3 drama languages, there is a positive correlation between story ratings and overall drama ratings. In other words, stories with higher story ratings also tend to have higher overall ratings. 

However, the correlation is not perfect due to some scatter in the data, particular in the K-Drama scatter plot. This means that some stories with high story ratings may have lower overall ratings, and vice versa.

Unfortunately, this means that we cannot decisively conclude that the story-line of a drama is a definite driving factor behind K-Drama's popularity!

## 6. Who the Actors are Influences User Ratings

Earlier on in Section 5.3, we have seen how male and female leads in the story are an essential part of dramas, and play a huge role in connecting with audiences, particularly female viewers. 

How about the face behind these characters - the actors? Are they a driving factor behind K-Drama's popularity? Let's find out! 

Check out the different correlation plots between user ratings on the drama's acting cast, and the overall drama ratings for all Korean, Thai, and Japanese dramas 

```{=html}
<iframe height="500" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://yeech1ng.shinyapps.io/actor_app/ "> </iframe>
```

As you can see from the graphs, there seems to be a positive correlation between acting cast ratings, and overall ratings for all countries. This can suggest that the actors a drama features may influence the popularity of the drama. If an actor is popular, ratings for the drama will most likely increase. 

For Korea, this means that generally, well-received actors are starring in the dramas, thus contributing to the highest ratings and high popularity overall compared to the other 2. 

Do you recognise these Korean actors?

![Korean Actors | source: South China Morning Post](images/korean_actors.jpg){width="550"}

With that being said, we note the difference in strengths of the correlation graphs. From the dispersion of the points on the plot, it seems that K-Dramas have the weakest positive correlation, followed by Thai, and then Japan. 

This could mean that for K-Dramas, although actors undeniably play a part in driving up popularity, actors may not be the most important driving factor behind immense popularity.

# Insights and Recommendations

With that, we have finally come to an end of my investigation of why K-Dramas are so popular globally. 

In case all these was too much for you to take in and remember, here is a list of the key insights derived from my analysis. OR, if you are an aspiring drama producer or director not from Korea, you can consider using these key strategies that Korea uses!

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**1. K-Dramas generally have the highest ratings given by users, as compared to Thai and Japanese dramas.**</span>

This proves that K-Dramas are indeed popular, and has won the hearts of many audiences. 

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**2. K-Dramas capitalise on global, popular streaming services like Netflix. **</span>

This helps to expand market outreach, and bolster viewership.

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**3. K-Dramas prioritise quality over quantity. **</span>

Instead of spending resources of producing a large number of dramas, or dramas with many episodes, divert them to producing high-quality dramas with good content. 

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**4. K-Dramas ditched the gender stereotypes, instead portraying strong female leads. **</span>

This deviation from traditional depictions of female leads as passive and dependent on the male leads is a breath of fresh air that many audiences, particularly female viewers will appreciate. 

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**5. K-Dramas strategically identify and tap on growing genres, such as Youth and Melodrama.**</span>

Don't just blindly produce dramas of traditionally popular genres, like romance or action. It's all about having foresight and seeing the potential in other genres!

K-Dramas produce dramas in seemingly under-developed genres before anyone else can, establishing their dominance, which can help with gaining market share.

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**6. K-Dramas avoid featuring controversial issues, like gender identity.**</span>

I personally believe that it is important to have more open conversations about such issues to acheive social change rather than ignore it, and one way is through greater representation of marginalised groups in media like dramas. 
However, I understand that this makes sense from a purely business perspective, as it can help avoid losing the support of viewers who may have disagreeing views, and maintain viewership and popularity.

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**7. K-Dramas star well-received and popular actors.**</span>

This helps with gaining more visibility and support from the fan-bases of the actors featured.
