Hello, welcome to my webpage! \^\_\^

I’m Yee Ching, a Year 2 Communications and New Media student at NUS, who made the fantastic decision to take NM2207 Computational Media Literacy this semester!

In my free time, you’ll probably catch me doodling away on my iPad, playing with my terrapin, watching shows, or napping away.

For this project, I decided to focus on one of my hobbies – watching K-Dramas (I promise I’m not a koreaboo).

As such, as an avid K-Drama watcher, I felt compelled to investigate the driving factors behind the immense popularity of K-Dramas, and find out: **What makes K-Drama popular?**
